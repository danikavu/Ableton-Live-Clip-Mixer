# Ableton Live Clip mixer

This module generates drum patterns from a random selection of Ableton Live Clips.
Ableton Live Clip files can be found [here](https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/#?item_type=sounds), in packs such as `Skitter and Step` etc.

While this could be done based on midi files, Ableton Live Clip drum kit setups are standardized and have some fire grooves.
